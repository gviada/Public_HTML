Keep you in the dark<br>
You know they all pretend<br>
Keep you in the dark<br>
And so it all began<br>
<br>
Send in your skeletons<br>
Sing as their bones go marching in... again<br>
They need you buried deep<br>
The secrets that you keep are at the ready<br>
Are you ready?<br>
I'm finished making sense<br>
Done pleading ignorance<br>
That whole defense<br>
<br>
Spinning infinity, boy<br>
The wheel is spinning me<br>
It's never-ending, never-ending<br>
Same old story<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus 2x:]</i><br>
What if I say I'm not like the others?<br>
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?<br>
You're the pretender<br>
What if I say I will never surrender?<br>
<br>
In time or so I'm told<br>
I'm just another soul for sale... oh, well<br>
The page is out of print<br>
We are not permanent<br>
We're temporary, temporary<br>
Same old story<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br>
<br>
I'm the voice inside your head<br>
You refuse to hear<br>
I'm the face that you have to face<br>
Mirrored in your stare<br>
I'm what's left, I'm what's right<br>
I'm the enemy<br>
I'm the hand that will take you down<br>
Bring you to your knees<br>
<br>
So who are you?<br>
Yeah, who are you?<br>
Yeah, who are you?<br>
Yeah, who are you?<br>
<br>
Keep you in the dark<br>
You know they all pretend<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[2x]</i><br>
What if I say I'm not like the others?<br>
Keep you in the dark<br>
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?<br>
You know they all... pretend<br>
You're the pretender<br>
What if I say I will never surrender?<br>
<br>
So who are you?<br>
Yeah, who are you?<br>
Yeah, who are you?
